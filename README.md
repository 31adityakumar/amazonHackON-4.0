# Amzon HackON - 4.0 Team Amazer_NITS

 The integrity and trustworthiness of product ratings and reviews, as well as the authenticity of products on Amazon, are critical 
to maintaining customer trust and satisfaction. Fraudulent reviews and counterfeit products pose significant challenges, 
undermining the credibility of the platform and harming both customers and legitimate sellers.
 The solution involves tracking product returns, using large language models (LLMs) to blocklist sellers, employing machine 
learning for review authenticity, and leveraging APIs for authentication. This method will enhance the integrity of product 
ratings and reviews and strengthen counterfeit detection on the Amazon platform.
